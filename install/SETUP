Build perl, apache, mod_perl and the required modules:

    Download perl, apache and mod_perl into /src/dir
    Build everything:

        $ cd install
        $ perl ./buildperl ~/g/perl/src perl-5.12.2 /PF perl modules postgres

    Change the perl executable, the location of the src directory, the perl
    version and the directory in which to install the software to the location
    of your perl binary (at least 5.12.1), your downloaded source tarballs,
    the version of perl you will be installing and the location to which the
    packages will be installed respectively.
