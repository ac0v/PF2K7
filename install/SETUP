Build perl, postgres and the required modules:

    Download perl, zlib and postgres into ~/src
    The files can be found in http://pjcj.sytes.net/src

    Build everything:

        $ cd install
        # mkdir /PF
        # chown --reference=. /PF
        $ perl ./buildperl ~/src perl-5.12.2 /PF perl modules postgres

    If necessary, change the perl executable, the location of the src
    directory, the perl version and the directory in which to install the
    software to the location of your perl binary (at least 5.12.1), your
    downloaded source tarballs, the version of perl you will be installing and
    the location to which the packages will be installed respectively.

    $ . ./setup
